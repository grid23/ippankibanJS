        "This page is sample experimentation around the manipulation and use of datasets"
      , "First, a huge dataset (15mb) of e-mails is read and parsed."
      , "From that set, a `collection` containing around 5000 `models` is created."
      , "From all the models, all possible *senders* are extracted to create the select list options."
      , "When a *sender* is selected, a subset `collection` of `models` corresponding to the *sender* is isolated and is used to display a list of e-mails."
      , "The top animation should not stop down because of heavy data processing. And It should stay as fluid as possible."
